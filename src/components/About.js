                <p>Designer of immersive, encapsulated applications that bring in influences
                of outdoor exploration and location based apps. With a background in UX and
                graphic design, creative content, immersive drawing installations and sculpture,
                I develop experiential, feeling applications. Iâ€™m a client-facing developer
                who works very well on larger teams, with collaborative pairs and broader
                multi-disciplinary teams. Experienced in fast paced environments, I craft
                efficient, on-time products.</p>
